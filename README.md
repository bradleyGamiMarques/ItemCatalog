# ItemCatalog
Udacity Item Catalog project


# Description

The item catalog project has students build an application from the ground up. This is my solution to the project.

## Getting Started:

To get started with this project you will need to have a couple of files.

* A Unix style terminal. Windows users, I prefer Git Bash. Mac users your regular terminal will be fine.
* The tools Vagrant and VirtualBox
* The virtual machine files: https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5acfbfa3_fsnd-virtual-machine/fsnd-virtual-machine.zip


## Starting up the virtual machine

1. Install the version of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1) for your operating system.
 _Windows users may have to disable Hyper-V_

2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)

3. cd into the directory with the virtual machine files then cd into the /vagrant directory

4. Use the command vagrant up to start the virtual machine.

5. Once that is complete use the command vagrant ssh to log into your virtual machine.


## Using this code

1. cd into the catalog directory.

2. Run the application.py file from the command line. python application.py

3. Navigate to localhost:8000 in a browser.

4. Application will be running here.
